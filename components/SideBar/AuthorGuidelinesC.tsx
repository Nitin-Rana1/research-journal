                Abstract:
            </b>
            <p>


                Articles must include an Abstract of 250 words. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results, and major conclusions. The abstract should not repeat the information which is already present in the title. References should be avoided.

                Keywords: Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords.

                Text: The paper must be divided into sections and subheadings starting preferably with Introduction and ending with Conclusion followed by Acknowledgement.

                All papers cited in the text, tables, and figures must be included in the references and all papers cited the references section should be cited in the text. Authors should monitor references at all phases of manuscript preparation.  In the event that an author cited has had two or more works published during the same year, the reference, both in the text and in the reference list, should be identified by a lower case letter like a and b after the date to distinguish the works.

                Introduction: The introduction should introduce the research problem that the study was designed to address and its significance. It should provide a clear statement of the problem, the relevant literature on the subject, and the proposed approach or solution. What gap is the current study designed to fill? In other words, the introduction should provide the information for the reader that he/she will need in order to understand and appreciate the science you will report on later in the article.

                The materials and methods should be complete enough to allow experiments to be reproduced. However, only truly new procedures should be described in detail; previously published procedures should be cited and the relevant literature should be provided in the citation. The important modifications of published procedures should be mentioned briefly. Capitalize trade names and include the manufacturer(s) name and address. Subheadings should be used. Methods in general use need not be described in detail. All the data should be applied to statistics.

                Experimental / Research work:.If the manuscript reports on work conducted on vertebrate animals, the appropriate institutional approval number should be listed in this section of the text. The results should describe the observations with clarity and precision. The results should be written in the past tense when describing findings in the
            </p>
            <p>


                Results: authors experiments. Previously published findings should be written in the present tense. The data should be arranged in a  unified and coherent sequence so that the report is developed clearly and logically. The same data should not be presented both in tabular and graphic forms, which should be numerically (Arabic numerals as 1, 2, etc.)  cited in the text and interpreted. Only such tables and figures as are necessary should be given. Interpretation of the data should be taken up under discussion; in some cases, however, it may be desirable to combine the results and discussion in a single section. Whenever possible use figures rather than tables as it is much easier to see trends in a graphical presentation of data. If you do use figures and tables each of these must be titled descriptively.

                Results should be explained, but largely without referring to the literature. Discussion, speculation and detailed interpretation of data should not be included in the Results but should be put into the Discussion section.

                Discussion: The discussion should interpret the significance of the findings in view of the results obtained in this and in past studies on this topic. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.

                Conclusion: State the significance of the results in the conclusion in a few sentences at the end of the paper.

                Conflict of Interest Statement

                Acknowledgment: This section is for anyone who assisted in the study whose contributions did not rise in the view of the principal investigator to authorship and to credit the funding agencies that supported the work etc. should be brief.
